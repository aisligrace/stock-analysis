# Module 2: Stock Analysis - VBA Challenge

## Project Overview

The purpose of this project was to perform an analysis on a stock market excel workbook using VBA. We had previously written out code to analyze the data for any year, including finding the total volume and returns and conditionally formatting them. Now for this part, we refactored our previous code to be more efficient and timely. While the results looked the same (which means it was correct), the code runs faster. I also found this code was easier to understand and follow process wise and made more sense logically. 
## Results

As previously mentioned, the end results between the original and refactored were the same. However, we were able to get faster results using the following. 


## Summary

The benefits of refactoring is having cleaner, more organized code that is easier to follow and contains fewer individual steps. I have found that the fewer the steps, the more I can limit potential mistakes. And the refactored code runs more efficiently and therefore finishes faster than the previous code.
I would say the main disadvantage of refactoring is time. While I had plenty of time to finish this particular project, circumstances are different in a real professional setting. You might not always have time to refactor if you are hitting up against a deadline. There is also a risk that if your code is already working correctly, you might get new errors while refactoring.
